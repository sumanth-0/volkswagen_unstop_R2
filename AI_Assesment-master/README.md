To download, open Pycharm and use Python manager called **pip**:
```
pip install <PACKAGE_NAME> 
```
Optional you could use below command to get specific version:
```
pip install <PACKAGE_NAME>==<VERSION_NUMBER>
```

## Description of data set:
Python scripts developed to perform analysis on Volkswagen car prices. 
The data was scrapped from the popular Polish website OtoMoto (https://www.otomoto.pl/) using Beautiful Soup Python library. 
Whole project is going to be based on Recurrent Neural Networks (casual RNN).

## Project description:
Whole project description could be found in folder: "project_report(in_Polish)".  
But as name can suggest it is written in Polish. Basically it's a report which was created as a part of
AI classes at university.  
In short, title translation of each subpoint:
"  
1. Description of the problem and data
2. Data preprocessing
3. Description of the applied neural networks
4. Discussion of results and conclusions
"

## TODO:
Maybe in the future there will be finished "hyperparameters tunning", no time to fix it now - doesn't work properly.  
Literature describing the concept of hyperparameters tunning:
