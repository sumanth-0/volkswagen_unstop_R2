As the machine learning engineer for this initiative, you are tasked with developing functionalities that not only convert customer support audio calls into text but also explore methodologies to extract insights from transcribed texts.\n\nIn this dynamic project, we leverage the power of `SpeechRecognition`, `Pydub`, and `spaCy` – three open-source packages that form the backbone of your solution. Your objectives are:\n  - Transcribe a sample customer audio call, stored at `sample_customer_call.wav`, to showcase the power of open-source speech recognition technology.\n  - Analyze sentiment, identify common named entities, and enhance user experience by searching for the most similar customer calls based on a given query from a subset of their pre-transcribed call data, stored at `customer_call_transcriptions.csv`.\n\nThis project is an opportunity to unlock the potential of machine learning to revolutionize customer support. Let's delve into the interplay between technology and service excellence.","metadata":{},"id":"d5e81b43-ccfd-4fc6-902c-59cd49aa9913","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"!pip install
